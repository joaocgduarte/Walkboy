## Prerequisites

Minimum SDK -> 21.

SDCard is required. If you don't have it will not create the mp3 files. Probably it could crash the application.

Also, some android phones might not be able to use FFmpeg (a dependency), which is necessary to convert the .wav files (youtube downloads) to .mp3 files, which will save you some space on the SDCard.

These two limitations will be fixed, probably. Hopefully soon. I want the user to choose between the SDCard or phone memory, as well as choose if they want to convert the .wav files to .mp3 files.

This application uses internet to download and search youtube content and recommend artists to listen to. No need for internet connection to listen to the downloaded songs.

## Installation

Two options:

1. Clone repo, open project on your IDE and run it on your android phone.
2. Download and install apk from this link: http://www.mediafire.com/file/y9s9b165drn78t9/walkboy.apk

## Usage

Pretty intuitive I think. Just remember to click on recommended artists to copy a song to clickboard and long click on songs and playlists to edit/delete them or change location of a song, for instance.
